# Awesome WebExtensions [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) 

> A curated list of awesome resources for [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) development.

WebExtensions are a cross-browser system for developing browser add-ons. To a large extent the system is compatible with the [extension API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) supported by Google Chrome and Opera. Extensions written for these browsers will in most cases run in Firefox or [Microsoft Edge](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/documentation/extensions/) with just [a few changes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Porting_a_Google_Chrome_extension).
